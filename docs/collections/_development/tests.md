abapGit uses dependency lookup as an approach for writing unit tests, see example in ZCL_ABAPGIT_TADIR, ZCL_ABAPGIT_FACTORY, and ZCL_ABAPGIT_INJECTOR

Unit tests that create and delete objects in the system are categorized as dangerous, these tests can be enabled via Advanced -> Settings

Use organization https://github.com/abapGit-tests for storing serialization test cases
