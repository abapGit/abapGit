Packages with a class that implements `ZIF_APACK_MANIFEST` (interface is automatically created at initial start of abapGit) can define metadata that is interpreted by clients which support the APACK package and dependency management framework. Such an implementation class must reside in the top-level ABAP package which is serialized by abapGit so that it can be detected properly. After the class is instantiated, it needs to have the field `ZIF_APACK_MANIFEST~DESCRIPTOR` populated with the respective APACK metadata.

**Note:** Don't put any functionality in such implementation classes, only use them to advertise APACK metadata.

The metadata follows the [POM format by Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates) and specifies additional information as well:
- `group_id`: Unique name for your organization or project, e.g. `github.com/larshp`
- `artifact_id`: Name for the project, needs to be unique together with the specified `group_id`, e.g. `abapGit`
- `version`: Version of your project, should adhere to the [semantic versioning concept](https://semver.org/), e.g. `1.85`
- `repository_type`: Currently fixed to `abapGit` as it's currently the only supported repository type and is set automatically during serialization
- `git_url`: The URL where your main repository is located, e.g. `https://github.com/larshp/abapGit.git`
- `dependencies`: Optional, only needs to be filled if this project has dependencies to other projects. You only need to specify `group_id`, `artifact_id` and `git_url` to identify the dependency. `target_package` is ignored during serialization. Moreover, versioning is currently not supported - that's why there is no version in this set of dependency data. **Note:** Be sure to specify the `git_url` for each dependency properly as this is currently the only way how dependencies can automatically be resolved.

If such an implementation class is detected during the serialization process, a corresponding `.apack-mainfest.xml` file will be created on the top level of the Git repository. This contains the APACK metadata information.

### Transporting APACK implementation classes

The interface `ZIF_APACK_MANIFEST` is automatically created as local object, i.e. in package `$TMP`. In case you intend to transport projects containing an implementation class to follow-on systems, you either need to remove the implementation class from the transport or ensure that `ZIF_APACK_MANIFEST` is available on each follow-on system in order to avoid syntax errors. So, either let abapGit create it in all systems (don't do that on production) or change the package assignment to a package with the same transport target as your projects and transport them together.

### Examples

See the sample code on GitHub (uses `IF_APACK_MANIFEST` which is exclusively available on the SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment, descriptor format is compatible with `ZIF_APACK_MANIFEST`):
- [YY Data Service](https://github.com/SAP/abap-platform-yy)
- [JSON ABAP Konverter](https://github.com/SAP/abap-platform-jak) (specifies a dependency to the YY Data Service)
