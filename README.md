## Contribution guidelines

* If you're new and want to help out, try one of [these](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). They should not be complicated to implement but require you to get the project up and running. Or pick something that annoys you. Fix a typo. Improve an error message. Correct some [coding conventions](https://docs.abapgit.org/development/guidelines.html). Or try something unusual just to see if it works and if it doesn't, open an issue.

* There are some useful tips in the [develompent](https://docs.abapgit.org/development/) page. Going through them might help you out. More details on how to submit a pull request can be found [here](https://docs.abapgit.org/development/contributing.html).

* Before starting any significant development, open an issue and propose your solution first. A discussion can save a lot of unnecessary work. It also helps others know that this is being worked on.

* It is in your best interest to keep the commits/PRs as small as possible and solve one thing at a time. The smaller your change is, the easier it is to review and it will be more likely to get accepted. 

* Commit often, whenever something is working, and is a step in the right direction do a commit or PR. This way other contributors can see the changes, and it will minimize the risk of merge conflicts.

* If you don't have the time or knowledge to fix the problem yourself, you can still make it move along faster by providing an accurate description or a repo which reproduces the issue.
